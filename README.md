## Rock Papper Scissors Game Python 3
Rock, Papper, and Scissors game using Python 3 saved as a python notebook.
open it on jupyter notebook.
inputs are entered as {0 for Rock, 1 for Papper, and 2 for Scissors}.
The main concept of the game is that the user inputs their choice, and the computer generates a random input, depending on it. The if conditions decide either the player wins or the computer wins and the result is printed out.
this beautiful thing was made using anaconda's jupyter and python 3.7, which both are free and there links are down below :
